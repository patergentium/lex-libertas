Conagent  
: A conscious agent. Either an indeperson or a deperson. A conagent is able to generate action in pursuit of a goal. The distinction between an indeperson and a deperson is in whether or not that goal was self-generated.

Indeperson  
: Independent Conscious Person. Conscious agent which generates its own goals.

Indepagent  
: Same as Indeperson.

Preconagent  
: Pre-Maturity Conscious Agent. An indeperson whose foreknowledge, experience and powers of reasoning are lower than the level of sui juris.
- The prefix here, "pre-" does not have a temporal meaning, but merely a meaning of degree. It denotes the general category of conagents which by nature can be at sui juris, but are not at the level of sui juris, whether because of youth, senescence, accident/injury or any other reason.

Pueragent  
: Puerile Pre-Maturity Conscious Agent. A preconagent who is expected to eventually develop to the level of sui juris. Most commonly children.
- Note well that it is not age which confers this legal designation, but cognitive status.

Senegent  
: A Senescent Pre-Maturity Conscious Agent. A preconagent who has aged to the point of losing their legal status of sui juris. Most commonly the elderly.
- Note well that it is not age which confers this legal designation, but cognitive status.

Deperson  
: Dependent Conscious Person. Conscious agent whose goals are set by another conagent.

Depagent  
: Same as Deperson.

Animal  
: An preconagent which will, by its nature and/or design, never attain to sui juris (unlike pueragents and senegents who either will or previously had, developed to sui juris). This class encompasses all natural biological conagents which are not biologically human.
- Note that for legal purposes the defining trait is not that it is a biological non-human life-form, but that it is incapable of attaining sui juris.
  - E.g.: A robot which has human-or-greater cognitive capacity and is in every respect an indepagent, is an indepagent.

Creature  
: Same as animal.

Mechanimal  
: Same as animal for all legal purposes, but for human readability, this word is the preferred way to refer to all preconagents which are non-biological, such as robotic pets.

Fictagent  
: A fictional legal entity is not actually conscious but represents the agency of some number of indepagents.

Corpagent  
: A type of fictagent which is commonly used for carrying out business activities.
