# Conscious Agency

Please see the glossary for definitions of terms.

## Hijacking

- A conagent whose normal operating parameters make it amenable by intention and/or design to being controlled by another conagent is not an indepagent, and is legally a depagent.
- A conagent whose normal operating parameters make it hostile to hijacking, but gets hijacked if imposed upon by force/duress/fraud is validly still an indepagent. However for the duration of its hijacking, it is considered to be a depagent.
- An indeperson whose nature by design qualifies it as an indeperson, but who volitionally surrenders control of their consciousness to another conagent, retains their status as an indeperson for the duration of their surrender, and the liability for their actions is **shared** between themselves (the actor) and the commissioner of their actions while they were surrendered.

## Indepagents

## Depagents

- Depagents cannot own property and their property rights are not recognized under law.
  - An indepagent who has been hijacked is the exception, as they retain their claim to all property owned **before** the hijacking, and to all property obtained **afterward**.
- All actions taken by a depagent are presumed to be commissioned by its owner and are imputed to the owner unless a credible record of lease/rental can be produced.
  - Indepagent owners should take care to maintain careful records of other indepagents whom they allow to commission their depagent.
    - Such records should clearly state at minimum the identity of the commissioning indepagent and the duration of the lease/rental.
    - License agreements which specify and circumscribe the valid actions and terms of use for the depagent while under the commission of the other indepagent shall have the effect of transferring liability to the commissioning indepagent.

- All depersons must have a clearly, easily visible tag/mark which uniquely identifies its indeperson owner.
  - While a deperson is acting in the pursuit of the goal(s) commissioned for it by another conagent, all legal liability for its actions falls on the commissioning conagent.
  - Where that conagent is a deperson, the liability is traced back as a chain of liability until a commissioning indeperson is found.
  - Where the commissioning indeperson cannot be traced, the owning indeperson inherits liability for the deperson's actions.
  - Where the commissioning indeperson cannot be traced AND the owning indeperson cannot be identified, ownership of the offending deperson is transferred to the plaintiff upon judgment favouring the plaintiff.

- Where depersons engage in the carrying out of transactions and/or purchase of property, the (trans)actions taken in obtaining and securing the chose are legally imputed to the commissioning indeperson.
  - Where the commissioning indeperson cannot be traced, the title to the chose falls to the owning indeperson.
  - Where the commissioning indeperson cannot be traced AND the owning indeperson cannot be identified, title to the chose returns to the original transacting partner from whom it was obtained.
